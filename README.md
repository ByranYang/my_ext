my_ext
======

A chrome extension that creates a second contextmenu that pops up after holding down right click for a certain amount of time. 

content_script injects a second contextmenu to each site's html on creation and sends messages to background.js to find out option names and sends commands for which actions to do.

Still need to work on css of contextmenu, addition of more options, and usability of options menu.
